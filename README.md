# WhereToShop

Where To Shop - Grocery list price comparison application for Android.

WhereToShop is a mobile application (currently being developed for Android) designed to help shoppers save money. Shoppers will first use WhereToShop to build a grocery list. Grocery lists in the WhereToShop application are similar to a typical grocery list on a mobile device. Users can add items, check items as off while they shop, and delete the list when they're done! The main purpose of WhereToShop is not the ability to merely create a grocery list, but to help users save money by determining (based on the products in the user's grocery list) which store nearest them has the cheapest price per item.
